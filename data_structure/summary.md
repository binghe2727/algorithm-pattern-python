### binary tree
1. traversal
    * preorder, midorder, postorder
    * BFS
    * DFS (1) recursive programming; 2) the stack data structure)
2. others
    * divide-and-conquer
        - for example: the longest path in a binary tree! very beautiful!
3. data structure:
    * given a stack: when we use it: DFS;
    * given a queue: when we use it? BFS;
4. TODO:
    * add the DP link on Zhihu to this repo
    * an important blog: https://blog.csdn.net/fuxuemingzhu/article/details/80487064
    * one recommended book from China: https://www.zhihu.com/question/279320198
    * define your problem-solving template: yes, it is a template for each question. Be professional to create the template
