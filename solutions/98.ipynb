    "# In a binary search tree, the lower bound and upper bound of a node refer to the smallest and largest possible values that can be stored in the subtree rooted at that node, respectively. More formally, let's define the BST property: for any node in a binary search tree, all values in its left subtree are less than its value, and all values in its right subtree are greater than its value. Given this property, we can define the lower bound and upper bound of a node as follows: The lower bound of a node is the maximum value that can be stored in its left subtree. That is, it is the value of the rightmost node in the left subtree, if it exists. If the left subtree is empty, then the lower bound is -infinity. The upper bound of a node is the minimum value that can be stored in its right subtree. That is, it is the value of the leftmost node in the right subtree, if it exists. If the right subtree is empty, then the upper bound is +infinity. Knowing the lower and upper bounds of a node can be useful in various operations on a binary search tree, such as searching for a value, inserting a new value, or deleting a value.\n"
